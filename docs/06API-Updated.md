### **1. Patient-Facing APIs**

These APIs are primarily consumed by the patient-facing frontend.

| Method | Endpoint                                | Provider(s)                        | Description                                                  |
| :----- | :-------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/auth/register`                        | Supabase Auth (Backend Wrapper)    | Creates a new patient user account. Collects initial profile data including `first_name`, `last_name`, `date_of_birth`, `email`, `password`. Optional fields like `home_address_json` (US format, namesake), `weight_kg`, `height_cm`, `medical_history_json`, `insurance_info_json` (optional, not for direct patient billing; potential future use for matching covered doctors), `preferred_consultation_mode` can be provided. **Optionally accepts `triage_session_id` in the request body. If provided for an active guest session, the existing anonymous patient record and triage session data will be associated with the newly registered user.** |
| `POST` | `/auth/login`                           | Supabase Auth (Backend Wrapper)    | Logs in an existing user (patient, clinician, admin) with email/password or OTP. |
| `POST` | `/auth/logout`                          | Supabase Auth (Backend Wrapper)    | Logs out the current user.                                   |
| `GET`  | `/patients/me`                          | Backend API                        | Retrieves the profile details of the currently authenticated patient. |
| `PUT`  | `/patients/me`                          | Backend API                        | Updates the profile details of the currently authenticated patient. Allows updating optional fields not provided at registration. |
| `POST` | `/triage/start`                         | Backend API                        | Initiates a new triage session. If the user is a guest, a temporary anonymous `patient` record is created (can be converted to permanent if the user registers when prompted). **`patient_current_location_json` (temporary, for this session, including lat/long) is captured here via browser geolocation or manual input (US city/state/zip).** Response includes `triage_session_id` and first AI question. |
| `POST` | `/triage/sessions/{sessionId}`          | Backend API, OpenAI/GPT            | Submits the patient's response to an AI question for the specified `sessionId`. The AI generates the next question or a summary if the triage is complete. |
| `GET`  | `/triage/sessions/{sessionId}`          | Backend API                        | Fetches the current status and progress of an ongoing triage session, including chat history and current AI-determined urgency. |
| `GET`  | `/triage/sessions/{sessionId}/summary`  | Backend API                        | Retrieves the final summary of a completed triage session, including symptoms, AI-determined `urgency_level`, `ai_recommendation`. If high/critical urgency, suggests nearest ER facilities based on `patient_current_location_json`. |
| `POST` | `/triage/sessions/{sessionId}/complete` | Backend API                        | Marks a triage session as completed by the patient. If the user is a guest, they are prompted to register (e.g., by calling `/auth/register` with the `sessionId`) to save their session data and access further services (like doctor consultation). **If the guest does not register when prompted, their temporary session data is not stored long-term.** |
| `GET`  | `/patients/me/triage/history`           | Backend API                        | Lists all previous triage sessions for the authenticated registered patient. (Includes sessions from guest mode if they registered immediately after). |
| `POST` | `/patients/me/consents`                 | Backend API                        | Logs patient's consent for specific `consent_type` (e.g., 'data_privacy_policy', 'video_recording_permission' - Note: video recording is currently NOT implemented) and `consent_version`. |
| `POST` | `/triage/sessions/{sessionId}/feedback` | Backend API                        | Allows patients to submit feedback (rating, comments) on the AI triage experience. |
| `POST` | `/video/consultations`                  | Backend API, Tavus/Twilio/Daily.co | **For Registered Users Only.** Creates a new live video consultation room after a doctor has claimed the case and licensing/proximity is verified. Duration: **20 mins max. NOT recorded. Only patient and one clinician.** If connection fails, restart is manual. Returns connection details. |
| `GET`  | `/video/consultations/messages`         | Backend API, Tavus                 | **For Registered Users Only.** Retrieves asynchronous video messages sent by doctors to the patient. |

| `POST` | `/triage/sessions/{sessionId}/claim`      | Backend API                  | Clinician claims a triage case. **System verifies clinician's license for the patient's state and proximity (within 50-mile radius of `patient_current_location_json` using geodesic distance) before allowing the claim.** |
| `PUT`  | `/triage/sessions/{sessionId}/urgency`    | Backend API                  | Allows clinician to manually override the AI-determined `urgency_level`. |
| `POST` | `/triage/sessions/{sessionId}/resolve`    | Backend API                  | Clinician marks a case as resolved. This action triggers: 1. Update to `triage_session.status`. 2. Creation of a `triage_billing_record` for the organization. 3. Potential update to patient's EHR (if integrated). |
| `POST` | `/video/messages`                         | Backend API, Tavus           | Clinician sends an asynchronous video message (using Tavus) to a patient. |
| `POST` | `/ehr/patients/{patientId}/notes`         | Backend API, EHR Integration | (If EHR integrated & consented) Clinician adds notes to the patient's EHR. Request includes `triage_session_id` for context. |
| `POST` | `/ehr/patients/{patientId}/prescriptions` | Backend API, EHR Integration | (If EHR integrated & consented) Clinician adds prescription information to the patient's EHR. |
| `POST` | `/ehr/patients/{patientId}/referrals`     | Backend API, EHR Integration | (If EHR integrated & consented) Clinician adds referral information to the patient's EHR. |

## üè• 7. **Third-Party Service Integration Points (Conceptual)**

These represent interactions with external services, often managed by backend logic rather than direct client-side API calls.

*   **EHR/EMR Systems (e.g., Epic, Cerner, Allscripts via FHIR R4)** (Optional per Organization)
    *   **Read Patient Data**: Fetch patient demographics, allergies, medications, vitals from the organization's EHR based on `patient_ehr_data.ehr_patient_id` and `ehr_integrations` config.
    *   **Write Clinical Data**: Push clinician notes, triage summaries, prescriptions, referrals back to the patient's EHR.
*   **RevenueCat**
    *   Manage organization subscriptions, process payments, handle trial periods.
*   **Tavus**
    *   Process video content for asynchronous messages.
    *   Generate AI summaries of video messages.
*   **ElevenLabs**
    *   Process audio for STT.
    *   Generate TTS audio from text.
    *   Perform sentiment analysis on voice data.
*   **OpenAI/GPT**
    *   Process symptom descriptions for diagnosis/urgency.
    *   Generate follow-up questions.
    *   Potentially assist with sentiment analysis or text summarization.
*   **Google Maps/Time Zone APIs**
    *   Provide geocoding, reverse geocoding, directions, and timezone information for US locations. Geodesic distance calculations may use local math functions with lat/long data.

**General API Principles:**

*   **Authentication**: All sensitive endpoints are protected and require Bearer token authentication (JWTs provided by Supabase Auth).
*   **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is enforced. For example, only a `Super Admin` can access `/superadmin/*` endpoints. Client Admins are scoped to their `organization_id`.
*   **Error Handling**: Standard HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500) with clear error messages in JSON format.
*   **Data Format**: JSON for request and response bodies.
*   **Versioning**: (Future consideration) API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).
*   **Rate Limiting**: Implemented to prevent abuse.
*   **HIPAA Compliance**: All APIs handling PHI are designed with HIPAA security and privacy rules in mind. Audit logs track access and modifications.
