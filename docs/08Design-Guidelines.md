* ### 6. Iconography

  Icons must be clear, universally understood, and support the user's journey.

  - 
  - **Style:** Simple, clean line icons with a consistent stroke weight (approx 1.5-2px). Rounded corners/ends for a softer feel. Avoid overly complex or decorative icons.
  - **Color:**
    - 
    - Default: Text - Medium Grey or Primary Action Blue if interactive.
    - Active/Selected: Primary Action Blue.
    - Semantic: May take on semantic colors (e.g., a warning icon in Orange).
  - **Common Icons:** Back arrow, send/submit, microphone (for voice input), info, close, menu (for mobile nav if needed), progress indicators (e.g., checkmarks for completed steps).
  - **Size:** Consistent sizing (e.g., 20x20px or 24x24px). Ensure adequate touch targets for mobile.
  - **Sourcing & Recommendation:**
    - 
    - Utilize a high-quality, consistent icon library.
    - **Consider using icons from reputable free sources like Material Symbols (Google Fonts), Phosphor Icons, Feather Icons, Tabler Icons, or similar sites offering SVG or web font icons under permissive licenses.** This ensures consistency and scalability, especially during initial development phases or when custom icons are not yet commissioned. Always check the licensing terms for any icons used.

  ### 7. Imagery & Illustrations

  - 
  - **Usage:** Keep imagery to a minimum to maintain focus on the triage process. When used, images and illustrations should be reassuring and purposeful.
  - **Illustrations (If used, e.g., for onboarding, success screens, or to visually break up long text sections):**
    - 
    - Style: Simple, friendly, and reassuring. Can be abstract or character-based.
    - Color: Align with the brand's color palette.
    - Purpose: To guide the user, reduce anxiety, or confirm completion.
  - **Photographs (If used, e.g., for background textures or very subtle contextual visuals):**
    - 
    - Style: High quality, professional, and relevant to a calm, modern healthcare feel.
    - Content: Avoid clinical or distressing medical imagery. Focus on neutral, supportive, or abstract visuals if photographs are deemed necessary.
  - **Sourcing & Recommendation:**
    - 
    - **For placeholder or initial imagery, consider using high-quality, royalty-free stock photos from sites like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay.** Ensure the chosen images align with the brand's tone and aesthetic (clean, professional, reassuring).
    - **For illustrations, free vector art sites (e.g., unDraw, Humaaans, Open Doodles â€“ checking licenses) can be a good starting point if custom illustrations are not immediately available.**
    - Always ensure that licenses for any sourced images or illustrations permit usage for your application type and that appropriate attribution is given if required. Prioritize custom assets for a unique brand identity in the long term.

### 8. Layout & Spacing

A clear, consistent layout is paramount for a stress-free experience. Employ a mobile-first grid system.

*   **Grid System (Recommended):** 8px grid system (spacing/sizing in multiples of 4px or 8px).
*   **Mobile Layout:**
    *   Primarily single-column for content flow.
    *   Header: App name/logo, potentially a menu or help icon.
    *   Content Area: For AI questions, user input, and triage information.
    *   Footer/Action Bar: Primary action buttons (e.g., "Next," "Submit").
*   **Desktop Layout:**
    *   Content can expand to a wider single column or a two-column layout if necessary (e.g., chat on one side, summary/info on the other), but simplicity should be maintained.
*   **Padding & Margins:**
    *   Screen Padding: 16px to 24px on all sides (mobile).
    *   Section Spacing: Consistent vertical spacing between elements (e.g., 16px, 24px, 32px).
*   **White Space:** Generous use of white space to reduce cognitive load and improve focus on the current task.
*   **Alignment:** Left-align text for readability. Center-align headings or short standalone text if it enhances clarity.
